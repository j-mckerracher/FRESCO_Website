                        <p class="text-left">Dependability has become a necessary requisite property for many of the
                            computer systems that surround us or work behind the scenes to support our personal and
                            professional lives. Heroic progress has been made by computer systems researchers and
                            practitioners working together to build and deploy dependable systems. However, an
                            overwhelming majority of this work is not based on real publicly available failure data. As
                            a result, results in small lab settings are sometime disproved years later, many avenues of
                            productive work in dependable system design are closed to most researchers, and conversely,
                            some unproductive work gets done based on faulty assumptions about the way real systems
                            fail. Unfortunately, there does not exist any open system usage and failure data repository
                            today for any recent computing infrastructure that is large enough, diverse enough, and with
                            enough information about the infrastructure and the applications that run on them. We are
                            addressing this pressing need that has been voiced repeatedly by computer systems
                            researchers from various sub-domains.</p>
                        <p class="text-left">The project is collecting, curating, and presenting public failure data of
                            large-scale computing systems, in a repository called FRESCO. Our initial sources are
                            Purdue, U of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and U of Texas at Austin. The data sets comprise
                            static and dynamic information about system usage and the workloads, and failure
                            information, for both planned and unplanned outages. We are performing data analytics on
                            these datasets to answer various questions, such as: (1) How do jobs utilize cluster
                            resources in a university centrally managed cluster? (2) How do users use or do not use the
                            options to share resources on a node? (3) How often are the typical resources (compute,
                            memory, local IO, remote IO, networking) overstretched by the demand and does such
                            contention affect the failure rates of jobs? (4) Can users estimate the time their jobs will
                            need on the cluster?</p>
